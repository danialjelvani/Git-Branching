#branch
git branch newname : makes new branch with the name newname
git checkout newname : switches to branch newname
HEAD in log & Circle in gitgraph point to current branch
git branch -d branchname : deletes branch
git branch -D branchname : force deletes branch
when a new branch is made a turn is made in that point but u will be going
in the same road unless u checkout to new branch and continue the way from the point u made the turn.
git checkout -b newname : makes a new branch and switches to it

#merge
git merge branchname : merges branchname with current branch
git merge --abort : to abort merging when conflicts happen and we want to undo merging
solve conflicts in vscode in the final file
git pull : merges current branch with remote
git pull origin currentbranch : merges currentbranch with originbranch on remote
git branch -a : shows us all the branches here & all the branches in the remote bcuz remote branches r hidden
git branch -vv : shows us which local branch is merged with which remote branch
git branch --merged : shows the merged branches
git branch --no-merged : shows the unmerged branches

#fetch
git fetch origin : shows the differences between origin remote branch and current branch withous merging anything
git fetch --all : fetches all the remote branches

#track remote branch
git checkout --track origin/testing : when theres a testing branch in remote but not in local and we want to add
and track that branch in local we use this code to make a local branch with the same name tracking the remote branch

#delete remote branch
git push origin --delete testing : deletes remote branch testing

#delete remote tag
git push origin --delete v1.5 : deletes remote tag v1.5

#when push is rejected bcuz the tip of ur branch is behind its remote counterpart
this is bcuz theres sth in remote which isn't in local like a license file and first we should: git pull origin main
then: git push origin main
we can also push with force even b4 the pulling code: git push -f origin main
but: git pull <remote> <branch_name> --allow-unrelated-histories
and then: git push <remote> <branch_name> seems to me the best answer.
